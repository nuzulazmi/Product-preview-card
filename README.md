## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I've learned several ways to use Flex properties in CSS, and I'm implementing them in this project, I only use one property in this project.
This is an example of CSS Flex I just learned:

-CSS
```
.example {
align-self: center;
}
```
Note: property "Align-self" will only work if the parent element is given the property "display: flex;".
The "align-self" property has several values ​​including: "flex-start, flex-end, baseline, stretch, auto"

### Continued development

-No Update

### Useful resources

Note: I actually don't use any resources from anywhere for this project, but I want to give one of the resources I usually use. 
Here it is:

- [Example resource 1](https://fontawesome.com/icons) - Fontawesome is one of the popular resources that many developers use. I really like fontawesome, because they have interesting and cool icons.
